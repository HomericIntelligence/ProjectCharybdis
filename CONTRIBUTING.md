# Contributing to ProjectCharybdis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ProjectCharybdis! This is the chaos and
resilience testing framework for the
[HomericIntelligence](https://github.com/HomericIntelligence) distributed agent mesh.

For an overview of the full ecosystem, see the
[Odysseus](https://github.com/HomericIntelligence/Odysseus) meta-repo.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`)
- [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) for environment management
- [Just](https://just.systems/) as the command runner
- C++20 compiler (GCC 12+ or Clang 15+)

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HomericIntelligence/ProjectCharybdis.git
cd ProjectCharybdis

# Activate the Pixi environment (installs CMake, Ninja, clang-tools, gcovr)
pixi shell

# Build the project
just build

# Run tests to verify setup
just test
```

### Install Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install hooks (clang-format, conventional commits, trailing whitespace)
pre-commit install
```

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
# List all available recipes
just --list

# Check formatting compliance
just format-check

# Run the full CI pipeline locally
just ci
```

## What You Can Contribute

- **Chaos test scenarios** — New fault injection tests and resilience assertions
- **Fault injection strategies** — Network partitions, latency injection, process crashes
- **Test harnesses** — Fixtures and utilities for chaos testing
- **Tests** — GoogleTest unit tests for chaos components
- **Dockerfile improvements** — Build optimization, security hardening
- **Documentation** — README updates, test scenario descriptions

## Development Workflow

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

Before starting work:

- Browse [existing issues](https://github.com/HomericIntelligence/ProjectCharybdis/issues)
- Comment on an issue to claim it before starting work
- Create a new issue if one doesn't exist for your contribution

### 2. Branch Naming Convention

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b <issue-number>-<short-description>

# Examples:
git checkout -b 5-add-network-partition-test
git checkout -b 3-fix-fault-injection-timeout
```

**Branch naming rules:**

- Start with the issue number
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens
- Keep descriptions short but descriptive

### 3. Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

| Type       | Description                |
|------------|----------------------------|
| `feat`     | New feature                |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation only         |
| `style`    | Formatting, no code change |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring         |
| `test`     | Adding/updating tests      |
| `chore`    | Maintenance tasks          |

**Example:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(chaos): add network partition fault injection

Implements configurable network partition simulation between
agent groups with automatic recovery after timeout.

Closes #5"
```

## Building and Testing

### Build

```bash
# Debug build (default)
just build

# The build uses CMake with Ninja generator and CMakePresets.json
```

### Test

```bash
# Run all tests via CTest + GoogleTest
just test

# Generate coverage report (gcovr)
just coverage
```

### Lint and Format

```bash
# Run clang-tidy
just lint

# Check formatting (clang-format v17)
just format-check

# Auto-format all source files
just format
```

### C++ Conventions

- **Standard**: C++20
- **Formatting**: clang-format v17 (enforced by pre-commit hook)
- **Build generator**: Ninja via CMakePresets.json
- **Dependencies**: Managed via CMake FetchContent (GoogleTest)
- **Sanitizers**: Use ASAN/TSAN for debugging memory and threading issues
- **Test isolation**: All fault injection must target test-namespaced NATS subjects only

## Pull Request Process

### Before You Start

1. Ensure an issue exists for your work
2. Create a branch from `main` using the naming convention
3. Implement your changes
4. Run `just ci` locally to verify build, test, lint, and format checks pass

### Creating Your Pull Request

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
gh pr create --title "[Type] Brief description" --body "Closes #<issue-number>"
```

**PR Requirements:**

- PR must be linked to a GitHub issue
- PR title should be clear and descriptive
- All CI checks must pass (build, test, lint, format)

### Never Push Directly to Main

The `main` branch is protected. All changes must go through pull requests.

## Code Review

### What Reviewers Look For

- **Test isolation** — Do chaos tests stay within test namespaces?
- **Correctness** — Does the fault injection behave as documented?
- **Memory safety** — No buffer overflows, dangling pointers, or data races
- **Cleanup** — Do tests clean up injected faults on completion or failure?
- **Formatting** — Does `just format-check` pass?

### Responding to Review Comments

- Keep responses short (1 line preferred)
- Start with "Fixed -" to indicate resolution

## Markdown Standards

All documentation files must follow these standards:

- Code blocks must have a language tag (`cpp`, `bash`, `yaml`, `text`, etc.)
- Code blocks must be surrounded by blank lines
- Lists must be surrounded by blank lines
- Headings must be surrounded by blank lines

## Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

Include: clear title, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, compiler/OS details.

### Security Issues

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**
See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the responsible disclosure process.
